            <h3>
            Hi there! I am Annie</h3>
            
            <p>
     Hello, I am annie A girl living in Mumabi Maharasthra, with my friends Lucy and Jack.
I am a self-taught baker, published recipe writer and the creator of bake with annie.<br>
                <br>
                
                I love to travel, eat good food and watch The Great British Bake Off. I'm a dessert enthusiast who loves baking and sharing recipes with the world. My passion for baking started at a young age,and I continue to explore new recipes and techniques.Welcome to our desert food website! We're passionate about bringing you the sweetest treats.I graduated from university with a Bachelor’s degree in Mass Communications and worked for over a decade as a copywriter. My career took me on some exciting adventures, from touring cruise ships to covering food festivals.I even worked at Australia’s biggest food magazine, creating content and cooking alongside talented chefs, food stylists and food photographers.A few years into my career, I enrolled in graphic design classes at night (which I loved). But two years later with my Diploma in Graphic Design in hand, I felt like I had nowhere to channel my newfound skills.Obsessed with baking and food blogs, I decided to join the fun and tentatively created Sweetest Menu in 2014. 
                
                <br>
                <br>
                
                I started out posting recipes here and there in my spare time.I quickly fell in love with the process of testing recipes, taking photos and writing endlessly about food. I was working on Sweetest Menu before work, after work and on the weekends.Finally after six years as a side hustle, and five months pregnant with my daughter, I went full time with Sweetest Menu in March 2020. </p>
